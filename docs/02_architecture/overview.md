# System Architecture Overview

## Core Architecture Philosophy

Bad AI implements a distributed, enterprise-grade architecture designed around three fundamental principles:
1. Multi-agent orchestration with mathematical guarantees
2. Knowledge-centric processing with semantic understanding
3. Visual programming with formal verification

This architectural approach enables complex AI behaviors while maintaining system reliability and performance at scale.

## System Layers

    - Real-time validation
    - Type-safe connections
    - Visual debugging tools

- **Development Features**
    - Real-time preview
    - Component library
    - Pattern templates

### 2. API Layer: GraphQL with WebSocket

The API layer implements a modern, real-time capable interface:

- **GraphQL API**
    - Type-safe operations
    - Efficient data retrieval
    - Batch operations
    - Query optimization

    - Real-time updates
    - Bi-directional communication
    - Stream processing
    - State synchronization

### 3. Core Processing Layer

The core layer consists of two primary systems:

- Context management

### 4. Knowledge Layer

The Knowledge Database (KDB) provides sophisticated semantic processing:

- **Vector Operations**
    - Semantic similarity search
    - Context-aware retrieval
    - Dynamic knowledge updates
    - Efficient indexing

- **Knowledge Processing**
    - Document analysis
    - Semantic understanding
