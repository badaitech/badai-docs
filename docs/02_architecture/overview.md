    C --> D[State Management]
    
    subgraph "Execution Layer"
        C1[Parallel Execution]
        C2[Resource Management]
        C3[Error Handling]
    end
```

    subgraph "Processing Stages"
        B1[Document Parsing]
        B2[Page Segmentation]
        B3[Chunk Generation]
        B4[Vector Embedding]
    end
    
    subgraph "Search System"
        C1[HNSW Index]

    participant A1 as Agent 1
    participant A2 as Agent 2
    participant K as KDB
    
    U->>R: Message
    R->>R: Intent Analysis
    R->>A1: Primary Task
    A1->>K: Knowledge Query
    A1->>A2: Subtask Delegation
    A2->>K: Context Query
    A2->>A1: Subtask Result
    A1->>U: Final Response
```

### 2. Knowledge Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Document
    participant P as Processor
    participant V as Vector Store
    participant S as Search
    
    D->>P: Input
    P->>P: Segmentation
    P->>V: Embeddings
    V->>S: Index
    S->>S: Optimization
