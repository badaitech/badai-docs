# Knowledge Database System

## Technical Overview

The Knowledge Database (KDB) is a specialized system for processing, storing, and retrieving knowledge using vector semantics and mathematical similarity models. It serves as the foundation for AI agent intelligence in the Chain Graph system by providing contextual knowledge and semantic search capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### Document Processing Pipeline

The system implements a hierarchical document processing architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Documents] -->|Initial Processing| B[Document Layer]
    B -->|Segmentation| C[Page Layer] 
    C -->|Semantic Chunking| D[Chunk Layer]
    D -->|Knowledge Extraction| E[Vector Layer]
    E --> F1[Question-Answer Pairs]
    E --> F2[Semantic Triplets]
```

Key Aspects:
- **Document Layer**: Handles metadata, versioning, and document organization
- **Page Layer**: Manages logical document segmentation
- **Chunk Layer**: Creates optimal semantic units with overlap
- **Vector Layer**: Generates and indexes 1536-dimensional embeddings

### Vector Processing System

The core of KDB utilizes high-dimensional vector space for semantic operations:

- Distance Metric: Cosine Similarity
- Index Type: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- Storage: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension

### Integration with Chain Graph

The KDB serves as a knowledge backend for AI agents in the Chain Graph system:

1. **Context Retrieval**
    - Agents query KDB using semantic search
    - Multiple weighted queries support
    - Time-decay relevance weighting
    - Context window optimization

2. **Knowledge Processing**
    - Automatic document segmentation
    - Semantic chunk generation
    - QA pair extraction
    - Knowledge graph building

3. **Agent Memory**
    - Long-term knowledge storage
    - Semantic similarity search
    - Context-aware filtering
    - Transaction-safe updates

## Query System Architecture

### Search Implementation

The KDB implements a mathematical similarity-based search system:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Query] -->|Embedding| B[Vector Representation]
    B -->|HNSW Search| C[Candidate Set]
    C -->|Filtering| D[Results]
    D -->|Ranking| E[Final Output]
```

Components:
- Vector similarity calculation
- Multi-query processing
- Result set optimization
- Cost-based execution planning

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Query Processing**
    - Parallel vector operations
    - Batch embedding generation
    - Query result caching
    - Cost-based query planning

2. **Storage Optimizations**
    - HNSW index for vectors
    - B-tree indexes for metadata
    - Optimized chunk size
    - Smart overlap calculation

3. **Resource Management**
    - Token usage tracking
    - Embedding cost optimization
    - Query cost estimation
    - Resource allocation control

## Chain Graph Integration

### Knowledge Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Chain Graph Node] -->|Query| B[Knowledge DB]
    B -->|Context| C[Agent Processing]
    C -->|New Knowledge| D[Knowledge DB]
    D -->|Updated Context| A
```

### Agent Knowledge Processing

1. **Context Building**
    - Semantic query generation
    - Context window management
    - Relevance scoring
    - Token budget optimization

2. **Knowledge Application**
    - Context integration
    - Answer generation
    - Knowledge verification
    - Response optimization

3. **Memory Management**
    - Short-term context
    - Long-term knowledge
    - Semantic deduplication
    - Priority-based storage

## Technical Specifications
