# Bad AI Platform

## Introduction

Bad AI is an enterprise-grade platform for creating, deploying, and orchestrating AI agents through visual composing and Chain Graph technology. The platform enables complex multi-agent interactions, knowledge sharing, and sophisticated AI behavior development through a visual programming environment while maintaining technical rigor and system reliability.

The platform combines several key technological innovations:
- Chain Graph system for visual AI behavior programming
- Knowledge Database with vector-based semantic processing
- Multi-agent orchestration system
- Enterprise-grade execution engine
